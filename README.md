# Introdutions

I'm a very recent Computer Science graduate who's just started in the big bad world as a Core Software Engineer, despite this I still can't keep myself away from education and somehow in the past 4 - 5 years my interests have... specialised, into not just CS but History, particularly  Late Iron Age Britain and Ireland to Early Medieval Britain and Ireland, even more particularly Religion and Culture in those time periods.

The purpose of this blog is primarily to learn. I'll be learning about History, Language, and Archaeology, all areas I did not specialise in. Just like so many other people in the world I'm a student, that means I'm going to make a \*lot\* of mistakes, if I do and you notice go ahead and tell me, message me or something and we can discuss whatever subject it is. My goals are to combine my interests and skills in CS \(particularly Machine Learning\) with the abundance of data that is historical studies to see if I can make something that works.

And apparently, you're coming along.
