# Linguistic hiatus

I created this blog not long after I graduated, and even sooner after I got my first graduate job as a Software Engineer; which of course is all very exciting and I feel immensely lucky to have landed on my feet so well when few graduates at the moment get the same opportunity. In fact a grad friend of mine remarked how glad she was that I managed to find a job where I do what I actually studied, which is a bit damning for the times that's in it.

 As well as all that I've just moved into my new first time semi-permanent home with my partner, of course all this has been keeping me quite distracted from personal projects, so unfortunately I had to abandon the Linguistics Coursera course for now. I'l try and get back to it next time the course is on and I'll still be doing amateur linguistic and language work that I could put up here, but for now this section of the blog will probably be a bit quiet.
