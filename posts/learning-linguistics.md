# Learning Linguistics

I'm currently taking the Coursera course "Miracles of Human Language: An Introduction to Linguistics" by Universiteit Leiden & Meertens instituut \(KNAW\) as a personal introduction to the field of Linguistics. It's something I've always wanted to do and admired, before I started my current job I even got offered a place on the Masters course Computational Linguistics at Birmingham University. I'll be hopefully updating this section weekly as a way to consolidate what I've learned and revise.
