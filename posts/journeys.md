# Scéalta

Though I like to write myself I'm really not very good, so here I'll practice until my writing is witty and my imagination is imaginative. Some of these scéalta will be big, some small, all of them will be  journeys though, to visit historic sites, museums, beautiful landscapes, or just a little bit of interesting  dinnseanchas.
