# Scéalta

Though I like to write myself I'm really not very good, so this is where I'll practice my writing. Sharing travels I take or just some of the best and oddest bits of Celtic literature. Some of these scéalta will be big, some small, all of them will be  journeys though, to visit historic sites, museums, beautiful landscapes, or just a little bit of interesting  dinnseanchas.
